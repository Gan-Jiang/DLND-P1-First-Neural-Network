# DLND-P1-First-Neural-Network

In this project, you'll build your first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. We've provided some of the code, but left the implementation of the neural network up to you (for the most part). At the very bottom of the notebook, you'll find some unit tests to check the correctness of your neural network. Be sure to run these before you submit your project.

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
